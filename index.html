            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Olivia and I'm based out of Ohio! My interest in tech is grounded in a life that in some ways was brought up on the internet. Though I do think there are definitely many issues with the internet (and social media as an extension) I do think a lot of good also comes from it, and I hope to contribute to creating a more beneficial internet. Outside of my interest in tech, I spend a lot of time recreating in the outdoors, learning art & craft skills, engaging with media (through books, music, TV shows, movies, YouTube videos, and more!) and cooking/baking.</p>
